# Plane Classification

The objective is to predict the manufacturer and the family of an aircraft. On the one hand, I implement and compare a Convolutional Neural Network and a Support vector machine in the notebook `train_classification_model`. On the other hand, I implement a Transfer Learning apporach by importing the weights of InceptionV3, that I compare with the initial Convolutional Neural Network. The dataset used contains more than 6000 aircraft images for about 30 classes of manufacturer.
